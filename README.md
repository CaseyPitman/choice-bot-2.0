# Choice Bot 2.0

### Can't decide? Let Choice Bot decide your fate.

The Choice Bot is one of my favorite projects. Born out of the frustration experienced when my family tries in vain to decide where to have dinner, the Choice Bot takes the stress of decision making out of your hands.

## Features

- Choice Bot will select from any number of given options.
- Choice Bot decisions are final and binding. Defy Choice Bot at your own peril squishy human.

## Technologies

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- JavaScript

## Notes

- This is actually my second version Choice Bot app. The first version ([Choice Bot](https://github.com/CaseyPitman/choice-maker)) was a blend of vanilla JavaScript and JQuery. When I began learning React, I couldn't wait to revisit this app. The ability to effortlessly manage state that React offered was perfect for an app that needed to handle a dynamic number of user inputs. I've made quite a few of these little 'toy apps,' but Choice Bot is my favorite. It's simple, it serves a specific purpose, it's fun, and it works. 

- When I made Choice Bot 2.0, I had not yet learned [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html), and as such state is managed via class components. This app seems ripe for a refactor to Hooks.
